The goal of this repository is to provide a place for us in the [IDEM group](https://www.telethonkids.org.au/our-research/brain-and-behaviour/child-health-analytics-research-program/infectious-disease-ecology-and-modelling/) to discuss code review, propose new topics in [issues](https://github.com/idem-lab/code-review/issues/new) and share meeting notes.
